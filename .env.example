# Cohere API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys

VITE_COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env (or rename it)
# 2. Replace 'your_cohere_api_key_here' with your actual Cohere API key
# 3. The .env file is already in .gitignore, so it won't be committed to version control
